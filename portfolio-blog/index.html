    <h1>An Image Compression Tool</h1>
</header>

<section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>As part of my recent portfolio project, I set out to build an Image Compression Tool using Node.js and the Sharp image-processing library. The journey was filled with challenges, new learnings, and valuable insights that molded the final product.</p>
    <p>The Image Compression Tool is a web-based application designed to optimize and reduce image file sizes without compromising quality. This tool leverages advanced image compression algorithms to provide fast and efficient compression, making it ideal for web developers, photographers, and anyone looking to reduce image file sizes for storage or sharing.</p>

    <h2>Team Members</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>ESTHER NNAMANI</strong> - FRONTEND</li>
        <li><strong>KESTER UZUM</strong> - BACKEND</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Two key features were critically considered while developing the compression tool: High Compression Efficiency and Real-Time Preview. The goal was to create an experience that would be both web and mobile-friendly.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
    <p>The inspiration for this project came from personal experiences of struggling to resize and share high-resolution images online. The constant frustration of longer upload times, large file sizes, and loss of picture quality inspired us to create a tool that compresses images efficiently without sacrificing quality. The goal was to make this tool accessible for photographers, students, researchers, and web developers, ensuring smoother workflows and better user experiences.</p>

    <h2>Choosing the Right Tools</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Node.js</strong>: We chose Node.js for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, making it perfect for handling real-time image uploads and processing.</li>
        <li><strong>Sharp Algorithm</strong>: Sharp is a high-performance image processing/compression library that supports various image formats, including resizing and format conversion. It's efficient and integrates seamlessly with Node.js.</li>
        <li><strong>HTML & CSS</strong>: HTML was used for the frontend interface, ensuring each feature was placed appropriately, giving users a smooth experience with a clean and responsive design.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Most Difficult Technical Challenges</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Image Compression with Sharp</strong>: Integrating Sharp into the project was challenging. Balancing image quality and file size was a major hurdle, as we wanted users to experience significant file size reductions without compromising image quality.</li>
        <li><strong>Handling Large File Uploads</strong>: We faced challenges managing large image uploads. Users could upload high-resolution images that exceeded several megabytes.</li>
        <li><strong>Deployment</strong>: Deploying the app on Vercel initially gave us a "404 error" after several tries. We finally deployed the app on GitHub Pages, where the process was more straightforward.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Balancing Compression and Quality</strong>: Image compression requires balancing file size reduction and maintaining quality, which varies depending on the image type.</li>
        <li><strong>Handling Large Files Efficiently</strong>: Setting size limits and using memory streams was crucial for ensuring that our app handled large uploads gracefully.</li>
        <li><strong>Frontend Design Matters</strong>: A simple, intuitive interface makes any app more accessible and user-friendly. Frontend design should never be neglected.</li>
        <li><strong>Deployment Considerations</strong>: Each deployment environment has its own challenges. Testing in different environments helped ensure smooth deployment.</li>
    </ul>
